# Genome-Searching-Algorithms
Description:
In a team of 5, we implemented 2 searching algorithms that searches genomes for a particular sequence. 
The 2 algorithms are Knuth-Morris-Pratt and Boyer-Moore-Horspool adapted. 

File:
The code implementations of KMP and BMH are in the Jupyter Notebook.
Our report contains the explanations of each of the algorithm and their time complexity analysis

Others:
Our presentation slides are attached too, if it's of your interest.
